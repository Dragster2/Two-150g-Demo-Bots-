# Total Time Spent 0 hours

# June 24, 2025 :Day 1, the start of two designs

The plan is too make one vertical weapon robot and one that is a giant vertical spinner. The plan for the vertical weapon one is to make a drum. I am going to do a similar design of this combat robot minotaur! For the giant vertical spinner is too make a 150g Huge. This is honestly a bad idea but why not!
