# Total Time Spent 6 hours

# June 24, 2025 :Day 1, the start of two designs

The plan is too make one vertical weapon robot and one that is a giant vertical spinner. The plan for the vertical weapon one is to make a drum. I am going to do a similar design of this combat robot minotaur! For the giant vertical spinner is too make a 150g Huge. This is honestly a bad idea but why not!

These are the batteries I am planning on using!

For the other elecronics, Both Bots are running 2 20s from Tunabot. Two maleki nanos from Turnabot. The weapon motor is going to be the rs2205. The are a little big but are good cheap and reliable motors in my oponion. For the esc for the weapon, am planning on a 30 or 35 amp esc.

I started on the huge battlebot! Here is also the electronic lay out. I made the wheels too. Might change them later on thought.

After sometime building I realized I made it too big so I am going to redesign it now.
This is the new lay out! Long but not as chunky.

Here is the final version! I still need to do weight calcs but I think its looking good. I think it looks a little goofy in my oponion but I think it looks better when I get it built. This is big for sure.

I had talk to Dylan about this bot and we agreed that this bot gets to be 200g because it unique robot. It can be lighter and probably make 150g but the problem is I would need to get CF for the lid and for the wheels and it would not make it on time Therefore all the other bots unless unique as this one has to be int he 150g weight limit. I believe this is fair because I do not know how good this would work. 

**Total Time Spent: 6hr**

# July 3, 2025 :Day 1, the start of the drum bot!
