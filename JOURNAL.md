# Total Time Spent 14 hours

# July 2, 2025 :Day 1, the start of two designs

The plan is too make one vertical weapon robot and one that is a giant vertical spinner. The plan for the vertical weapon one is to make a drum. I am going to do a similar design of this combat robot minotaur! For the giant vertical spinner is too make a 200g Huge. This is honestly a bad idea but why not! The weapons are going to be made out of tpu 95a and the rest of the bot can be anything else. For both of my bots, there main body (That is white in te photos are made out of a different stiffer version of tpu 95a. The armor (that is the black part is going to be normal tpu 95a.

These are the batteries I am planning on using! They are small but powerfull batteries that should last more than enought time that it needs.

For the other elecronics, Both Bots are running 2 20s from Tunabot. Two maleki nanos from Turnabot. The weapon motor is going to be the rs2205. They are a little big but are good cheap and reliable motors in my oponion. For the esc for the weapon, am planning on a 30 or 35 amp esc.

I started on the huge battlebot! Here is also the electronic lay out. I made the wheels too. Might change them later on thought.

After sometime building I realized I made it too big so I am going to redesign it now.
This is the new lay out! Long but not as chunky.

Here is the final version! I still need to do weight calcs but I think its looking good. I think it looks a little goofy in my oponion but I think it looks better when I get it built. This is big for sure.

I had talk to Dylan about this bot and we agreed that this bot gets to be 200g because it unique robot. It can be lighter and probably make 150g but the problem is I would need to get CF for the lid and for the wheels and it would not make it on time Therefore all the other bots unless unique as this one has to be int he 150g weight limit. I believe this is fair because I do not know how good this would work. 

**Total Time Spent: 6hr**

# July 3, 2025 :Day 2, the start of the drum bot!

Today I started on the other robot that is the drum bot. Same electronics as the other bot. This bot is a fun design that hits hard, drives good, and is reliably. I started with the uprights. The red motor is big so I had to get creative with it.

I updated the armor to be more bulky might be a little hard to tell. The armor will not be solid due to weight but it should absorbed and take hits well.

# July 4, 2025 :Day 3, Working on the drum bot!!

Today I started with touching up the main body and worked on the weapon. I was able to finish the robot after a little bit more. This is two wheel drive drum. I edited the armor a little bit more. I added the antlers and the bottom stops to help take the weapon energy alway.

It now ways 198.65 grams. I kept a little extra weight so if I need to change anything or something is heavier. Time toHuge bot. I already did a brief look at the weight and it should be good. Time to look at it some more!!

Lets gooooo! Huge is in weight too at 197.56! A little over two grams to spae again lets goo!

Now both bots are finish!! Also the way to turned them on is making a custo switch with an xt30 and two negatve or positive wires to finish the loop to turn it on. I hope these bots do good!!
