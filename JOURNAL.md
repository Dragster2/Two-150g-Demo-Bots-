# Total Time Spent 0 hours

# June 24, 2025 :Day 1, the start of two designs

The plan is too make one vertical weapon robot and one that is a giant vertical spinner. The plan for the vertical weapon one is to make a drum. I am going to do a similar design of this combat robot minotaur! For the giant vertical spinner is too make a 150g Huge. This is honestly a bad idea but why not!

For the other elecronics, Both Bots are running 2 20s from Tunabot. Two maleki nanos from Turnabot. The weapon motor is going to be the rs2205. The are a little big but are good cheap and reliable motors in my oponion. For the esc for the weapon, am planning on a 30 or 35 amp esc.

I started on the huge battlebot! Here is also the electronic lay out. I made the wheels too. Might change them later on thought.
