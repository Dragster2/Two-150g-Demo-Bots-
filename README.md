# Two-200g-Demo-Bots-

# About the bot
Both bots have a tpu weapon! There frames and armor are made out of Tpu! These Demo bots and potentially two more will be used at the Highway to undercity Event! They both run the same electronics that are two n20s. rs2205 for the weapon motor, maleki nano, same battery that is 2s 300mah, same weapon esc that is a 35amp. These bots with my friends bots are going to be used as demo bots. 

# Why I made them. 

The reason I want to make these is first, to make more little robots like these and so people can have fun with them at the event. The plan is to let people fight them against each other. I really hope this will be fun. I also hope people would get into this sport!! The reason I made these style robots is for many reasons. One reason was because I wanted to try different kinds of robots. Second is because I never made them before and I hope they are good!!
